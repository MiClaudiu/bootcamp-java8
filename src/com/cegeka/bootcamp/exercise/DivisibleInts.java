     *
     * Explanation:
     *  number = 123
     *  1 does evenly divide with 123. 123 / 1 = 123 with 0 remainder
     *  2 does not evenly divide with 123. 123 / 2 = 61 with 1 remainder
     *  3 does evenly divide with 123. 123 / 3 = 41 with 0 remainder
     *
     *  Thus the returned array will be [1, 3].
     *  The array must contain only distinct elements
